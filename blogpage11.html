        <p class="bt-blog-para">Between The Eras Tour, the upcoming concert movie, the impending release of 1989 (Taylor’s Version) and now lending her star power to boosting the NFL, it really is Taylor Swift’s world and we are just living in it. The megastar has influenced every realm she’s stepped into, from music to moviemaking and beyond. But as she’s been breaking records and turning the world into Swifties, I have found myself just as captivated with her fashion, particularly her street style.

            Swift’s outfits may only be spotted in the brief patch of sidewalk between whatever hot restaurant she’s visiting and her car, but she works those quick walks like a runway. Her style has seen many evolutions over the years as she’s embraced the different eras of her career—often tying in her outfits with the themes of the album she’s currently promoting—but this past year, she has seemed to find a look that’s all her own. Think elevated basics in timeless neutrals, crisp accent colors and, of course, that classic red lipstick that never goes out of style. So if you need some fall outfit inspiration, why not turn to T-Swift and channel her this season?</p>
